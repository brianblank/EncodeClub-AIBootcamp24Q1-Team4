## Project 1 - ChefGPT

The ChefGPT application uses LLMs to simulate a chef.  It has 4 different roles as follows:
1. Suggest random ingredients that can be used in a recipe
2. Suggest a dish that can be made with a given set of ingredients
3. Provide a recipe for a specified dish
4. Give critique for a given recipe

To run the application, simply type:
```
python Project1/main.py [<uniqueid>]
```
unique id is optional.  When not provided, 3 chefs will be picked at random.  When the unique id is provided, all 3 chefs roles will be assumed by that given unique id.

Valid Unique ID values are in main.py as follows:
```
# Unique IDs for the team members
team4_uniqueids = [
    "YTZTDV", # @Max Degenhardt 
    "4KTBAl", # @Guy Cioffi 
    "LMaGmf", # @Brian Blank 
    "0EY4BL", # Ritik Bompilwar
