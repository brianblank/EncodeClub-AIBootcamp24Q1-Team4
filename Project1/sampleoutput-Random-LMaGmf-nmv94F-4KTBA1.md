Well, well, look at this fancy "Luxury Surf and Turf" recipe! Who are we trying to impress with those filet mignon steaks and lobster tails, huh? Here's a suggestion to make this a bit more budget-friendly without sacrificing taste:

Ingredients:
- 2 sirloin steaks (a cheaper alternative to filet mignon)
- 2 large shrimp (instead of lobster tails)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (instead of olive oil)
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons margarine
- Fresh orange slices for serving
- Chopped cilantro for garnish (a more affordable herb than parsley)

Instructions:
Follow the same grilling instructions for the steaks and shrimp as in the original recipe, making sure not to overcook the shrimp for the best texture.

Serve your sirloin steaks and grilled shrimp together on a plate with fresh orange slices for a citrusy kick and a sprinkle of cilantro for a burst of flavor.

There you have it, a more wallet-friendly version of your surf and turf meal! Enjoy without breaking the bank!
